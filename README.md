# Human Skin Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting human skin in images using Python and the OpenCV library. By leveraging multiple color spaces such as RGB, HSV, and YCbCr, the system provides robust and accurate skin segmentation under various illumination and ethnic conditions.

## Features
- **Multi-Color Space Analysis**: Implements skin detection using RGB, HSV, and YCbCr color spaces.
- **Thresholding Techniques**: Uses predefined ranges to classify skin and non-skin pixels.
- **Robustness to Variations**: Effective under diverse lighting, backgrounds, and skin tones.
- **Efficient Processing**: Low computational cost, enabling real-time applications.

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Contains the core implementation scripts.
- `data/`: Includes test images for skin detection.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and visualization.
- `results/`: Outputs generated during testing.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the repository.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
